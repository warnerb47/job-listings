## My process

### Built with

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - JS framework
- [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/) - a state management pattern + library for Angular
- [Nx](https://nx.dev/) - build system + fast CI
- [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) - automates CHANGELOG generation, the creation of GitHub releases, and version bumps
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Css pre-processor


### What I learned

Handle stage management with NGXS.

### Continued development

Next step:
- Deep dive on state management with NGXS
- integrate TDD with jest for unit test and cypress for component testing
- use Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [setup angular store with ngxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D6UJE_FuZ4) - This helped me to setup project structure with Nx and manage state with NGXS.
